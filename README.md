LED flashers are semiconductor integrated circuits used to turn on and off groups of light emitting diodes either sequentially or according to a programmed pattern.

The flasher is built to offset the low amperage draw that LEDs operate on and will not cause rapid flashing. Additionally, the flasher relay has the unique ability to control the flash rate of the vehicles LED directional indicators. This can include, but is not limited to, light, fog, deck, and grill lamps.


Component List - 

To make a mini LED flash light, the circuit can be enclosed in a small plastic or metal casing with a switch to turn it on and off. A small keychain or lanyard can also be attached to the casing to make it easy to carry around.

Additional components, such as capacitors or transistors, can be added to the circuit to control the brightness or flashing pattern of the LED.

All component lists have to been given below.

Component List -

•	PCB - made by JLCPCB
•	Transistor - TTA 1943
•	Capacitor - 470µf/ 25v
•	Resistor - 100 KΩ
•	LED - 5mm
•	Power Source - DC 12v


Transistor Pin Out - 

TTA - 1943

The TTA1943 is a PNP bipolar junction transistor commonly used in power amplifier circuits.

Please note that the pinout diagram of the TTA1943 transistor is the same as that of most other bipolar transistors. It is always important to check the datasheet of the specific transistor, as there may be some variation in pinout between different transistor models.

Here is the pinout of the TTA1943 transistor:

•	Base
•	Collector
•	Emitter


Feature of LED Flasher Light -

•	Low component count
•	Low power consumption
•	Adjustable flashing rate
•	Wide operating voltage range
•	Compact size
•	Easy to integrate
•	Reliable
•	Easy to modify
•	Low heat generation
•	Multiple LED support


Make 12v LED Light -

Since it is a 12v LED light project circuit, for that we need to use DC-12v led light. Though we are using 3v led light, for that we need to convert 3v led light to 12v led light.

We use 4 pieces 3v LED light to make a 12v LED light. We connect one LED positive leg with another LED negative leg. In this way we will leg a 12v LED light.

This way, we might make 2 pieces 12v LED light. Then we connect 2 pieces 12v LED light negative leg with each other.


Connect Capacitor with Transistor -

To make this LED flasher circuit, 1st we connect capacitor positive leg with "Base" leg of TTA-1943 transistor and make same connection with the rest transistor and capacitor.

Then connect capacitor negative leg with another transistor "Collector" leg and again make the same connection with the rest capacitor and transistor.

Connect Resisitor with The Circuit -

Now we need to connect resistor with the circuit. 1st we make a series connection between this two resistor. Then we connect these two resistors two empty terminal with both transistor "Base" leg.

Connect LED with The Circuit -

From these two pieces 12v led light, we got three terminals. We got two separate positive terminals and one common negative terminal. We connect two positive terminals with "Collector" leg of two transistors.

Again thanks to JLCPCB for best quality PCBs.


Connect DC-12v with Circuit -

For power source, now we need to connect power supply with the circuit. You can use 12v battery or 12v adapter. 
Connect DC-12v positive cable with both transistor "Emitter" leg and connect DC-12v negative leg with 12v LED negative leg.

Soldering And Cleaning -

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Final Action -

Our circuit is completely ready for use now. We need to power switch ON and enjoy the effect of LED light.
